Big-Crunch
==========

[AS3] Global Game Jam 2011

The concept of the big crunch is the exact opposite of the Big Bang. It's when all of the atoms of the universe come together and compress. Everything dies. Except that you've found a way out - a small rift in the space-time that you can use to escape the Big Crunch. If only for a little while.

This was a team effort between me and Edmund Dubois
